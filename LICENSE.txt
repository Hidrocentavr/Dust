I would call this a "Museum Policy" you can look but you cant touch/take.

If you want to use this code for any reason you must have written(or typed) permission to do so, unless you are a contributor for the mod who is listed in this document.

If you would like to get permission to use this code shoot me an, 
Email:  mowmaster@outlook.com  
Subject Line: Permission to use Dust Code

I will try to reply within 24-28 hours, unless you get lucky enough to catch me the week(s) I am on vacation, in which case you will have to wait a bit longer.

I can be found in #minecraftforge irc, and sometimes in streams on beam.pro (Tlove and BluSunrise usually)
