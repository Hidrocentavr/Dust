Dust is a mod that aims to pull in the authors favorite things from older/current magic mods and other anime influences into a mod filled with a complex researching/exploration system that rewards players with utility items, effects, and abilities as they play the game.

progress on the mod is streamed occasionally on mixer.com/mowmaster
and there is a trello with some basic features and ideas: https://trello.com/b/NCSmPZoF/mod-dust
