This is a starting list of all the planned features and whatnot that will be going into the very early stages of "Dust"
(I am not necessarially open to ideas or suggestions but I will take them into consideration as I continue to work on "Dust")


==================
Version 0.1.0
==================

Add in the crystal shard items/models
- As worldgen will come later the basic recipie for now will be: iron ingot + dye color = shard type

Add in basic crystal tool sets for each, and possibly armor sets as well.
- These will be basic items at first but I would like to do custom models for each.

Basic shard usability will be added in the form of recipies


==================
Version 0.1.5
==================

Basic Oregen in the form of ores, Will be revised if i figure out clusters and ther're multimine/growth features

==================
Version 0.2.0
==================

[Pushed to a Later Version]  Add crystal shard clusters, these will have 4 different models.
[Pushed to a Later Version]  - Clusters will be based on 4 "Growth" states thus why 4 models for eash are required

Add pretty blocks that can be fun to build with.
- I will be taking suggestions for what kind of "pretty" blocks to add as im not a creative thinker when it comes to doing that sort of thing.
- In this version all clusters will give off light, this may change a bit in the future ;)

Possibly get some basic world gen for clusters in the game. The goal is to have the clusters generate, if all else fails and I get frusterated I will make an ore and revisit it later
- Clusters will gen based on biome/ tempature, also there are a few types that will become more scarse then the others for balancing reasons for future versions.
- Add a config option to enable recipies from last version even with the worldgen. Default will be false.



==================
Version 0.3.0
==================

I will make an attempt at adding crystal cluster growth.
- To prevent farming I will try to add in "when was the last time I grew" checks along with exponential time to get to the next growth stage, ex. stage 1-2 short:stage 14-15 24 hours???
* The reason for this type of growth will make sense later on with some of the utility items, blocks, and their properties.

Add properties to shards (other then from v0.010) also add in cluster special properties.

Add in the obtainability of dust and some basic uses.
- ex recipie: shard + hammer = dust
* I may try to use some api stuff to see about adding macerator/pulveriser/sagmill recipie for them as an automatic alt to the hammer.

==============================================================
I have more version ideas but this is good enough for now
===============================================================
