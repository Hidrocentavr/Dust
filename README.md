# Dust
"Crystal ore is found rarely in small pockets deep within the world.
Simply mining this precious resource reveals a cluster of colored and seemingly highly volatile gems.
You have noticed that living creatures that brush up against these clusters cause them to explode just as  violently as when they are activated by another explosion or fire arrows.
Further research may uncover why this phenomenon occurs." ~Player 243

possibly keeping me at home more often then not. If you feel inclined to support this project after fulfilling your own needs you can do so here: https://www.patreon.com/mowmaster
